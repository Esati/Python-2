The page limit is an attempt at signaling this. If you want to do more than I expect, that is completely up to you and it doesn't set the standard for others.\n",

    "\n",
    "__NLP is increasingly used in Finance:__ New data sources are sought to help make better decisions, and the use of unstructured, textual data has become more common. Such data needs to be processed to create quantitative measures that can be used as inputs to quantitative models. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Machine Learning is increasingly used in Finance:__ Larger amounts of available data make it more difficult to manually choose appropriate predictors for outcomes of interest (e.g. stock returns, default of a debtor) and classic regression models overfit the data if there are many explanatory variables relative to the number of observations. Machine learning methods can help choose the predictors that matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Complement to the goal of learning Python:__ We need some application that can be used to help you gain more experience with Python. Applications that you aren't very familiar with yet hopefully make things more interesting and allow you to learn things beyond the programming itself."
